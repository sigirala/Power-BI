In delving into historical arrest data using Power BI, our focus shifts to understanding law enforcement actions. By visualizing arrest distribution across boroughs, we gain insights into the geographic dynamics of police interventions. Demographic insights into the age, race, and gender of those arrested offer valuable perspectives on the individuals involved. Detailed examinations of arrest counts help identify recurring issues, empowering law enforcement with actionable information for targeted interventions based on temporal and spatial considerations.
