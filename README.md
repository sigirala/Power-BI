In delving into historical arrest data using Power BI, our focus shifts to understanding law enforcement actions. By visualizing arrest distribution across boroughs, we gain insights into the geographic dynamics of police interventions. Demographic insights into the age, race, and gender of those arrested offer valuable perspectives on the individuals involved. Detailed examinations of arrest counts help identify recurring issues, empowering law enforcement with actionable information for targeted interventions based on temporal and spatial considerations.

Through visualizing historic complaints data with Power BI, we're trying to uncovering insights into crime patterns. We're looking at where crimes happen, how they've changed over time, and breaking them down by type and location. Understanding the demographics of victims and perpetrators helps us see who's involved. By examining complaint counts and specific crime types, we can pinpoint persistent issues. These visualizations offer practical information for law enforcement, aiding in focused interventions based on when and where incidents occur.
