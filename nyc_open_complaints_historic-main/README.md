Through visualizing historic complaints data with Power BI, we're trying to uncovering insights into crime patterns. We're looking at where crimes happen, how they've changed over time, and breaking them down by type and location. Understanding the demographics of victims and perpetrators helps us see who's involved. By examining complaint counts and specific crime types, we can pinpoint persistent issues. These visualizations offer practical information for law enforcement, aiding in focused interventions based on when and where incidents occur.
